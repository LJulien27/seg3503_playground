here's what happened when I ran the calculator

first test of spot bugs

all the bugs at the start

Changed this inside the src folder

made this change to string conversions to double

it was pretty clear that final should be replaced with static here
![image](https://github.com/LJulien27/seg3503_playground/assets/90732174/878bd1ec-225d-4845-a029-e91e89d344e9)

so I did

removed the else here because it seemed to cause fault
![image](https://github.com/LJulien27/seg3503_playground/assets/90732174/2d7af61f-ad7d-441b-803e-27201f261278)

this made me change the code as well
![image](https://github.com/LJulien27/seg3503_playground/assets/90732174/34a6455c-aedd-4883-84ef-26f56ebe58f8)

I didn't completely understand all the errors in the code but they were shortened after my changes so I did what I could and am happy with what I did
